A salvaged infrared LED is used instead of a normal LED or schottkey diode in the second clipping stage. The input is switchable between the input jack and a contact microphone inside the pedal enclosure, directly below a strip of 60 grit sandpaper. SPECIFICATIONS 1590BB-style enclosure in \u201ccast iron\u201d finish true bypass 3PDT uses 9v CENTER NEGATIVE power supply, One-Spot or similar very loud FUNCTIONS GAIN Overall gain of transistor distortion. Higher values are very \u201cVelcro-y\u201d VOLUME Main output volume. Surprisingly uncomplicated. FILTER Passive low-pass filter, good for taming the contact mic's output at higher gain. MODE Switch to toggle between input jack audio source or contact mic audio source TIPS / TRICKS At higher gain, the contact mic can produce microphonic feedback. This can be sort of controlled with the sandpaper. The sandpaper works best with harsh objects, try: flat files, screwdrivers, screws, nails, barbed wire, etc. Note that it'll probably dull the tool but it'll be worth it! The volume control on guitars is helpful for getting more subdued overdrive sounds. That's not exactly what the Lotek is made for, however.

This covers manufacturing + assembly issues. Incorrect power connections (power supplies with wrong polarity, too much power, etc), wear and tear from normal use, and issues due to modifications are not covered by said Warranty (although you should absolutely email us with any mods you do). We will repair, replace, or refund depending on the circumstances. Shipping will be paid by the buyer.","title":"USER GUIDE"},{"location":"#summary","text":"Lotek is a two-stage distortion effect based on a popular circuit.
